# Suit-21
Suit 21  is a card game for between two and six players. The game uses a standard shuffled deck 
of playing cards from which each player is dealt a hand of five cards. In each round of the game, 
players take it in turn to assess their hand and can swap one card for another dealt from the pack, 
with the aim that their hand should contain a sub-set of cards in a single suit that scores exactly 
21. 
In this game, cards score according to their rank value (e.g., 2 of Hearts scores two, 3 of Clubs 
scores three, and so on), while picture cards (Jack, Queen, and King) score 10. Aces can score 
either one or 11, with the value more beneficial to the player automatically chosen. 
The game ends when a player scores exactly 21 points in a single suit, or when there are 
insufficient cards remaining to play another full round. If a player scores 21 from a single suit, 
other players that have not yet had their turn in the current round should have one more 
opportunity to score 21. If multiple players score 21 after a completed round, then the point is 
split equally among those players, otherwise the point is awarded to the only player to score 21. If 
the deck runs out of cards before a winner is declared, then no point is scored in that game.
